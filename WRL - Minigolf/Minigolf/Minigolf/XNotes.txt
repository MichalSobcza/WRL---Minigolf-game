6#Gravity --- Gravity needs to be re-written, right now its based on the distance of the player from the 
ground which is wrong as the ball falls really fast when its away from the ground but then slows 
down when it gets closer.

The ball needs updated textures but that can be done anytime. Now someone needs to take a look at how we can
make the ball move, like it would in real life after being hit with a golf club. That can be done in many ways
but two that comes to my mind are:

1. The value of force can be stored in a club class and then 'transferred' to the ball on collision.
2. Pressing the button will set the force directly in the ball class which then will be added to velocity.
We will just add the animation of club swing later on.

First option is more realistic but will require a bit more coding and i guess its unnecessary.

How I think it should work is that when player holds down the space some indicator appears somewhere
(that can be added later on) and based on the value on the indicator ball 
should 'be fired' in the same direction as where the camera's looking.
